## Process to Discover and Present Meaningful Insights
I began by using SQL to view all the KPIs and their expected results, ensuring a clear understanding of the data's structure and key metrics. The data was then imported into Power BI from the SQL database for further analysis.

### Steps in Power BI

#### Data Transformation
- **Additional Columns**: Added "Day Number" and "Month Number" columns to the table, enabling the sorting of charts chronologically instead of alphabetically.
- **Data Cleaning**: Confirmed data integrity by removing all duplicates, ensuring a clean and reliable dataset for analysis.

#### Data Importation
- Imported the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI, ready for visualization and further analysis.

#### Dashboard Creation
- Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI, visualizing all Key Performance Indicators. The dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of sales performance, highlighting trends and patterns in the data.

#### Insight Presentation
- Kept track of meaningful insights drawn from the analysis, presenting them in a clear and actionable manner.

### Key Insights

#### Order Patterns
- Orders peaked on weekends, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays, especially during the evening hours. This insight can help optimize staffing and inventory management during peak times.

#### Monthly Trends
- July recorded the highest number of orders, indicating a seasonal trend that can be leveraged for targeted marketing campaigns.

#### Revenue Insights
- The "Classic" category generated the most revenue, suggesting a strong preference for traditional pizza options.
- The "Large" size contributed the highest revenue, indicating a higher demand for larger pizzas.

#### Top Performers
- "Thai Chicken Pizza" was the top revenue-generating item, making it a critical product for promotions.
- "Classic Deluxe Pizza" had the highest quantity sold and the most orders, indicating its popularity among customers.

#### Underperformers
- "Brie Carre Pizza" generated the least revenue, orders, and quantity sold, highlighting an area for potential menu reevaluation or targeted promotions to boost sales.

By leveraging SQL for data extraction and Power BI for data transformation and visualization, I provided a comprehensive analysis that informed strategic decisions and highlighted areas for improvement. This project showcased my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights, driving business growth and enhancing operational efficiency.
